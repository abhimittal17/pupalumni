                <p className="p-2  text-justify space-x-4">Through the establishment of the Punjabi University Alumni Association, Punjabi University is heading towards the fulfillment of its sacred duty to provide a platform which is very essential and aims at multi-dimensional objectives. Punjabi University always feels proud of its entire alumni who, after gaining education and knowledge from here, have achieved glorious heights in different fields; have earned great name in home and abroad and have set beautiful landmarks of human ideals. Each alumni holds an immensely rich treasure of the sweet and sour experience of the student days. The happy memorable moments of the genuine feelings of the time spent with the classmates and friends; the bonds built with the teachers during the exchange of knowledge and the decisive turns of the challenges and the dreams woven in the colorful environment of the University, which enlightens caresses and kindles a yearning in each and every happy or sad moment of the ongoing life. It is mainly from such noble bonds of souls that life gets its real and complete meaning. Otherwise all steps of successes and failures; professional hazards and achievements; worldly rat' race and bewitching dreams and desires for pure relationships make every sensitive soul restless. In the deep-dark corners of each person's psyche, the pleasant images of his/her precious moments and emotional response lie dormant but these are greatly cherished. Poet Surjit Pattar has worded the glory of such moments in this poetic utterance:</p>
                <p className="p-2  text-justify space-x-4">"Let us go Pattar and search the forgotten and lost places, Which are the spots where we have left the unwritten poems."</p>
                <p className="p-2  text-justify space-x-4">This University Campus has kept in custody hundreds of written and perhaps thousands of unwritten poems of each alumni. For celebrating the written ones and to compose the unwritten; to search the lost ones and to write the new ones like the rising Sun, the alumni association of your own University is knocking at your door. It is taking pride in remembering you and in sending an invitation. It is like the long-living tradition of Punjabi Culture in which all the married daughters, who have left their parental home after finding their husbands, visit and revisit their parental home and village during the Teej festival in the month of Saavan. This association provides a forum to revel in our entities, to share our attainments to call on our parental home and to repay our debt to this University by tightening the knot of emotional relations through larger societal activities. In this initial step of the alumni, all of us and the Punjabi University especially shall feel highly obliged by the constructive co-operation, the valuable suggestions and befitting contribution of each old student.</p>
